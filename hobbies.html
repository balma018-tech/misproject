                <img src="images/hobby1.jpg" alt="Me painting floating lanterns" height="100" width="300">
                <h3>Painting</h3>
                <p>I love painting because I get to use my imagination and be creative. My favorite things I've painted include the floating lanterns, my chameleon Pascal, and a family portrait. My favorite painting memory is when I taught some children in the village how to use watercolor paints, which sparked my passion of sharing art with the world. Eventually, I'd love to open an art studio where I can provide free art classes to people who might not otherwise be able to use art as a form of expression.</p>

            <div class="hobby-card">
                <img src="images/hobby2.jpg" alt="Me holding a pie that I baked" height="100" width="300">
                <h3>Baking</h3>
                <p>I love baking because I get to try new recipes from around the world! I also ask people in the village if I can try out their recipes passed down from their ancestors. Baking exposes me to a wide variety of skills and I love to bake for others. My favorite thing to bake is pie, because there's so much variety and because it's a community builder. Who doesn't want to come meet the queen and share a pie?</p>

            <div class="hobby-card">
                <img src="images/hobby3.jpg" alt="Me singing my favorite song" height="100" width="300">
                <h3>Singing</h3>
                <p>I love singing because it allows me to share my thoughts and feelings in a way that connects people. Similar to painting, I teach some children in the village to sing as well. Around the holiday season, we all get together and go door to door singing carols, which is one of my favorite things to do around the holiday season. I also love to sing while I paint and bake, which ties all my hobbies together.</p>
